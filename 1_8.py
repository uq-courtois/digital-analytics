print(2+2)

# Additional solutions:
x = 2
print(x+x)

x = 2
y = 2
print(x+y)

# Although a shorter solution is preferred, these solutions are also correct as 
# they just separate the input/output. These is no hardcoding involved because we 
# can still change the number at the input level and the output would update accordingly.
