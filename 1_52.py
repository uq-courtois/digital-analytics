number = 10

while number/2 >= 1:
	number = number/2
	print(number)

# Additional solution:

number = 10
while number >= 1:
    print(number)
    number = number/2

# Again, the order of steps within the while loop can change as long as it 
# matches the logic of the while loop conditional statement
